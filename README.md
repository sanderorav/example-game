Thank you for opening my project!

## Highlights :sparkles:

* Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Get pygame. To get it, type the following text on command prompt: _pip3 install pygame_
* To run the game, run _game.py_ by double-clicking on it. If that doesn't work, run it using an IDE like Thonny.

### How to play üéÆ
* To play the game, click "Play" and the game starts.
* Use the arrow keys to control the character and try to collect as many bubbles as possible.
